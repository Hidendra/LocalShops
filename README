LocalShops - A cuboid shop plugin for Bukkit
http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/17131/
===============================================================================

=============================
Installing
=============================
Simple copy LocalShops.jar to your <bukkit-directory>/plugins/ and then start
Bukkit!  Most configuration of the plugin can be done via in-game commands.
For those adventurous or for changes requiring editing of the config file, it
is required to edit the config while the plugin is not running.  The best way
is to stop Bukkit, edit the file, and then start Bukkit.  It is not supported
to edit while the plugin is running!


=============================
Permissions
=============================
LocalShops has different types of shops that can be used, global and local.
Global shops are accessable and configurable based upon a world locale, while
Local shops are accessable and configurable based upon a cuboid within a world.
Permissions are separated to allow for different permission levels and as such
the type needs to be included.
